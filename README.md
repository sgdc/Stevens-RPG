Stevens RPG
===========

Well, you can read the docs and see the code... the docs will probably help you the most. <-- Said by nearly every teacher on campus

To Build
--------

Make sure to get the submodule [GamePlay 3D](https://github.com/blackberry/GamePlay) needed for running the code.

Within GamePlay, compile both gameplay-encoder (Visual Studio project file located within gameplay-encoder folder)

Next, compile GamePlay itself. A Visual Studio solution file is located in the root of the GamePlay directory. You only need to compile the gameplay project itself, though feel free to play with the sample projects.
# Remember to compile both Debug and Release builds

Now you can go into Code/StevensRPG and compile the project to run it
