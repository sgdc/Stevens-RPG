IDEAS

-Each building on campus is a town in the game

-Player starts in a town corresponding to a freshman dorm, Hayden, Davis, or Humphries

-WCPR moves around each town as the player visits them, setting up moble units
	-Each time you see them, they have a different ridiculous budget item with them (tank, space shuttle, etc)
	
-Team Magma/Team Aqua parody - Res Life/Registrar
	-Dunno if that'd work
-Raveche = Giovanni, takes over Res Life, etc.


-CPAC chapter of the game
	-Fight against cosplayers

-Zombie-fighting chapter
	-EAS Ghost
	-Undead Alum
	-Awkward Zombies
	-Enlist help of Vinnie (other vinnie) to fight zombies
	
	
-Get help from WCPR to activate the Babbio Space Ship, use it to fly to Howe Space Center, the endgame area


-Were-whittaker

-Lt. Search

-Tutorial taught by Dubovskiy
	-Ees seemple, use attack
	-Where to heal? Ees seemple, l'hopital
	(this is stupid)

-Final boss: Raveche
	First form: human
	Second form: Robo-Raveche (and Ro-babbio)
	Third form: Demon Raveche
	
	
QUESTIONS:
	-Perspective for battle?
		-Side view (Final Fantasy VI, Paper Mario)
		-Front/Back view (Pokemon, Lufia II)
	-Overworld map or everything same size?
	-Masked tiles or multiple layers?
